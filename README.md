<h2 align = 'center'>⚠️A word of warning...</h2>
This repository contains 'omics data-type based pipelines from my general role as a bioinformatician. These are not cleaned, nor are they transportable. However, I figured they are worth allowing others to use if they want!

<h2 align = 'center'>▶️ Usage</h2>
To run many of these scripts, users must have access to a high performance computing environment. They are often in pairs with the same name, with the shell script (ex. shell.sh) created to submit the working script (shell.R) to an HPC environment.

The user must update the bash script to the appropriate parameters for their unique HPC. These were built on an HPC using command line with SLURM.
